# C/C++ to assembly with execution

> **What is it ?**
> This repository has been forked from the original project [YNH/CPP-to-assembly](https://github.com/ynh/cpp-to-assembly).
> This project was led by students from the Institute of Technology of Nantes. Our first aim was just to understand how the original application worked.
> Then, we addend a few minor modifications. Like, for exemple the ability to link asm to code and not only code to asm.
>
> This present repository is an extension to the project. We plan to add an interface where the user can execute his code (if it has a main function)
> and interact with by using some `cin` &ndash; `scanf`.


## Lauch the application
> It is mandatory to have an up to date version of gcc  

First of all, you have to clone our repo, `https://github.com/EnzDev/cpp-to-asm-Executor.git`
Then,install the application and start the server by doing the followings commands :
```
$ cd cpp-to-asm-Executor
$ npm install -d
$ npm install coffee-script

$ npm start
```

After everything just visit [localhost:8008](localhost:8008)

Git is GREAT !!
