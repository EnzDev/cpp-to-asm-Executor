# C/C++ to assembly with execution

> **What's this ?**
> This repository is originally a fork of [YNH/CPP-to-assembly](https://github.com/ynh/cpp-to-assembly).
> This is a student project at the Institute of Technology of Nantes. First of all, our aim was just to understand how it works.
> We also do some minor modifications like the ability to link asm to code and not only code to asm.
>
> That an extension of this project. We want to do an interface where the user can execute his code (if it has a main function)
> and interact with it if he uses some `cin` &ndash; `scanf`.
